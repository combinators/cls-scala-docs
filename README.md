## Documentation of the Combinatory Logic Synthesizer (CL)S Framework

This repository houses the official documentation for the Combinatory Logic Synthesizer (CL)S framework.

The documentation is hosted at [combinators.github.io](https://combinators.github.io/).

## Improving the documentation

Clone this repository, edit the [markdown files](src) and test the result in your local browser using
```scala
sbt runMain pamflet.Pamflet src
```

Visit the [Pamflet website](http://www.foundweekends.org/pamflet/) for editing documentation.

When done, open a pull request against branch `source` including your markdown files.

**Do not try to push the generated documentation!**

Travis will automatically build and update the website, once your request has been accepted.

The documentation source is kept in branch `source` and the compiled output in `master`.
